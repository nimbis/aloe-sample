aloe-sample: This is a very simple example of how to use aloe to write
tests that drive a web browser and check for expected results.

The two tests present verify that a web browser can load visit
google.com, enter a search query, submit the form, and see a result.

To run these steps, you will first need to install aloe-webdriver
(perhaps in a virtualenv):

	pip install aloe-webdriver

Then run the tests:

	aloe

You should see a web-browser window pop up briefly, and aloe report
something like:

	Ran 2 tests in 4.675s

	OK

At this point, you can start writing your own tests by adding new
files to the features directory. See the following documentation for
many steps which are available to be used:
